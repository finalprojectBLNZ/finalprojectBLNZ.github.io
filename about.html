      <h1 class="abouttext">Biography</h1>
      <p class="aboutsubtext">Hello! Thank you for stopping by and wanting to learn more about myself and the work that I do. 
          Currently, I am an undergraduate student at UNC Chapel Hill dually enrolled in a biostatistics master's program at UNC as well.
          In my free time, I really enjoy playing video games and watching anime. I am also allergic to milk.
          I started photography in 2018 and it has become a huge passion of mine, the entire process- prepping, shooting, and editing- is always a 
          blast and I really look forward to producing some of the best work around for you!
      </p>
